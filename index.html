        <p>Its time now. Time to sit for something that will determine the future of our lives. The moment
            has come. The thing that we have been waiting for our entire lives is here.</p>
            
        <p>I want to take a moment to wish you the very best in your national examination. These exams are just another chapter in the story youâ€™ve been writing for so long, 
            filled with moments of hard work, late nights, and the determination to succeed. I have no doubt 
            that everything youâ€™ve done up to this point will carry you forward and guide you through. your
            efforts will surely be rewared, and each exam you take will reflect the brilliance and thee potential
        that I see in you. I know you can do this and I belive in you my juice.</p>
        <p>The exams can sometimes feel like storms in our lives. But remember, you've already gone
            through storms before, and youâ€™ve always come out stronger. This is just another challenge, 
            another wave youâ€™ll ride with grace. Every question is just a new step toward your dreams, and 
            even when the path seems tough, you have the strength to keep moving forward. I believe in your 
            abilities and know that with each exam, youâ€™ll find your way, no matter how difficult the climb 
            may seem.</p>
            
        <p>Through all of this, I want you to know that I am with you. Whatever twists and turns this 
            journey takes, you wonâ€™t face them alone. I will always be here to support you in any way I can, 
            and even when it feels like the weight of the world is on your shoulders, know that Iâ€™m here to 
            help you carry that load. Iâ€™ve always had faith in you, from the first day to this very moment, 
            and I trust that your hard work and dedication will shine through. You have something special 
            within you, a determination that I admire, and thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ll always stand by you. Coz despite
            circumstance and despite situations, you still stand strong and came this far, so why give up now?
            Theres not a reason to give up.</p>
            
        <p>As you sit for these exams, I want you to go in with your head held high and your heart full of 
            confidence. Believe in yourself, Zus. You have already accomplished so much, and this is just 
            one more step on the path to even greater things. Wear your pride like a jacket, the colorful jacket
            that Joseph wear and went into the world to become the governor and let your 
            confidence be the strength that leads you through. Youâ€™ve got this! No matter what happens, 
            remember to trust in your abilities, because I do, and I know you are more than capable of 
            conquering these exams.</p>
            
        <p>I wish you all the best, the very best in your exams, the worlds best in your exams.</p>

        <p>Always remember that we were meant to soar and the ground is not a place for us but the skies</p>
